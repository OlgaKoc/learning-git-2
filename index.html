    <h1>Hotel California</h1>
    <h2>The Eagles</h2>
    <p>On a dark desert highway, cold wind in my hair<br>
            Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
            Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
            My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim.<br>
            I had to stop for the night.</p>
    <p>There she stood in the doorway I heard the mission bell<br>
        And I was thinkin' to myself<br>
        This could be heaven or this could be hell<br>
        Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way<br>
        There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say 
        </p>
