        <p>On a dark desert highway, cold wind in my hair<br>
            Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air<br>
            Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light<br>
            My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim.<br>
            I had to stop for the night.</p>
        <p>There she stood in the doorway I heard the mission bell<br>
            And I was thinkin' to myself<br>
            This could be heaven or this could be hell<br>
            Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way<br>
            There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say</p>
        <p>Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
            Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face<br>
            Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>
